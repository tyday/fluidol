importSealInformation.py gets info from fluidols current website and drops it into an excel spreadsheet

I had some issues getting the information, it's not organized very well and I downloaded it in multiple selections. An organized sheet which attempted to drop information into categories and an unorganized sheet which grabbed everything and dropped it into different columns.

uploadSealInformation.py, for some reason, can't see fluidol_index
I copied the file and dropped it into fluidol_index/management/commands
